'Coach K [Kevin Lee, co-founder of Quality Control Music] was always been telling me to rap for a long time. One of my bros called me and we spoke over the phone for about two or three hours and I basically stated I'm planning to take it serious. Prior to that, I never actually thought of rapping. Coach K told me he is certain I should start rapping because of my personal image, my life style. 'You got a lifestyle or an image you might as well rap about what's going on.' I tried it and it started to move fast so I stuck with it.'His first mixtape, Perfect Timing, was launched in April 2017. The beginning of what could possibly be his Hard trilogy arrived a few months later, once Harder Than Hard dropped in July. Too Hard, his third mixtape in a year, arrived in December, and it also contained his greatest hit up to now, 'Freestyle.' His other track, 'Suddenly,' featuring Moneybagg Yo, picked up radio play and started to develop excitement around Lil Baby.He did two years in jail. 'Last two years I had been in prison,' he explained in Sept. 2017. ' It's been an amazing blessing [since I was released from prison]. Selling drugs ended me up in prison. I had a five year sentence and I did two. Once I went home, just about everything appeared to be on point. That's exactly why I labeled my first project Perfect Timing. Everything has ended up going great since, I wouldn't change anything. The jail bid that I did, it changed me and motivated me.'Many are calling him the next big thing in hiphop. 'People tell me, 'This is the new Atlanta right here,' ' Pierre 'Pee' Thomas, co-founded of the Quality Control music, told Noisey. 'I don't feel like it's been an artist that came and took the lane from Atlanta as far as, like, what's real. When I listen to Lil Baby, it put me in a mind of where it was with Gucci Mane and Young Jeezy and T.I. Back to the trap. It put me back in that space. Like he's the new version of that.'There's a straightforward, honest intent behind his name. He's 23 yrs . old, therefore what's the deal with the moniker' 'I got the name Lil Baby,' he told XXL, "because I always hung around older dudes. When I was like 10 I was hanging with n***as like 18, 19; even now I hang around older dudes. I'm the baby out the crew. So they just started calling me Lil Baby."The young Atl rapper is booming rapidly.Among the best debuts of this year is Lil Baby's Harder Than Ever album, writing him in amid a jam-packed number of the very best young rappers on the rise. With his ascension taking place incredibly fast, the Quality Control artist is preparing to dominate Atlanta, GA. Whilst it might be a difficult task to accomplish considering the talent which the Georgia community holds, Baby has shown a potential to deliver whenever it is important. Here's an example, the "Yes Indeed" rapper now has three songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at the same time, further propelling him in a upward direction.Any tune which includes Drake is likely to get you on the charts so the inclusion of "Yes Indeed" on the Billboard Hot 100 isn't totally surprising. Having said that, Forbes reports that two additional cuts coming from Harder Than Ever appear on the list counting down the top 100 songs every week. Even as it had beforehand leaked, Baby's official collab along with Southside, aptly titled "Southside," came out at number 79 on the chart. Straightaway following was the rapper's collab with Gunna and Lil Uzi Vert as "Life Goes On" clocked in at number 80. The achievement comes immediately after the album remarkably debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 earlier this week.With QC totally supporting him, we could possibly be observing the growth of the next Atl super star. Soon after getting persuaded by Quality Control Music's Pee and Coach K, and having arrived home following a lengthy time in jail, Atlanta up start Lil Baby only has 3 undertakings to his name in 2017, however his riding, motivationally compelling records like 'Ride Or Die', 'My Dawg' & 'My Drip', have many checking for his refreshing viewpoint. Seeing so many different people seeking his tracks, it's hard to observe that the 21 yr old hadn't regarded entertaining a rap career until finally earlier this year.Lil Baby Scores 3 Simultaneous Hot 100 SinglesA feature by Canadian hip-hop superstar Drake powered the already trending young Atl rapper born Dominique Jones straight into the heights of the Billboard singles chart. Immediately following debuting on the Hot 100 a week ago at No. 49, their collaboration "Yes Indeed" jumps to No. 6 there this week.And it's not the only one. Two additional records with Jones as lead musician at the same time chart there this week, although not in the Top 10. His record "Southside" debuts at No. 79, whilst "Life Goes On" with guests Gunna and Lil Uzi Vert appears close behind at No. 80.The three singles appear on Jones' new project Harder Than Ever, that amazingly hits No. 3 in its opening frame on the Billboard 200 album chart. The record comes in at No. 2 for both the Top Rap Albums and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts as well, right behind Post Malone's reigning Beerbongs And Bentleys.The near-immediate success of "Yes Indeed" makes sense granted its robust catapulting performance. Last week at Spotify, it had been the third most streamed track of the week together with pretty much 11.5 million domestic plays. Which is reflected on both Billboard's Rap Streaming Songs chart as well as on the all-genre Streaming Songs, where "Yes Indeed" takes No. 2 behind Childish Gambino's "This Is America."Remarkably, the single did not move from its No. 16 slot on R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales week-on-week, implying that paid for downloads was not the dominating factor in its remarkable Hot 100 climb.Even ahead of that popular Drake co-sign, Jones had made an impact on the Billboard charts. He previously reached the Hot 100 with the 2017 single "My Dawg," which actually peaked at No. 71 previously this year. While its associated commercial mixtape Harder Than Hard did not reach the Billboard 200, its follow-up Too Hard from last December got to No. 80 there.Two out of three of Jones' vocal cohorts on those records have got further Hot 100 tracks currently. Drake dominates the chart's top reaches at this moment, reclaiming the No. 1 spot with "Nice For What" and retaining the No. 3 spot for "God's Plan." Not far outside the Top 10, he reappears as a featured act upon BlocBoy JB's "Look Alive" (No. 12) and Migos' "Walk It Talk It" (No. 14). "Life Goes On" guest Lil Uzi Vert appears on two other songs this week: Travis Scott's "Watch" at No. 60 and Playboi Carti's "Shoota" at No. 67."Yes Indeed" seems very likely to stay in the Hot 100's Top 10 in a few days in addition. It has consistently held onto the No. 2 spot on Spotify's daily domestic charts, logging around 1.5 million plays there in each Twenty four hour timeframe.Speaking on the achievement, Lil Baby not too long ago said to Complex, "Everything is crazy, coming from never being in the limelight to being well-known. Especially in Atlanta, where some of the craziest stuff has happened. Like people coming up to me like, 'Nobody ever told you that you look like Lil Baby'' But I'll be like, nah. Or like, somebody told me that. I'll never just say, it's me. But I actually see people walk up on me with their phone on Google, like, 'Look!' Whether I'm at the gas station or I be at the store, I be there by myself. I be regular."<br><br><p><a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat download</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat soundcloud</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat trap house</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat mp3 download</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat free</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat 2018 free</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat 2017</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beats 2018</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat 2017 free</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat with hook</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat brothers</a><br> <a href="https://rfrproject.blob.core.windows.net/rfrblob/Lil-Baby-Type-Beat.html">lil baby type beat freestyle</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
